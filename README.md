# Graph Neural Networks

<div align="justify">

This repository contains **two projects demonstrating Graph Neural Networks (GNNs)** implemented with PyTorch Geometric:

1. **GCN on Cora** – Performs **node classification** on the Cora citation network using a **Graph Convolutional Network (GCN)**. The notebook includes steps for data loading, model definition, training, evaluation, and visualization of node embeddings using PCA.

2. **GraphSAGE on MUTAG** – Performs **graph classification** on the MUTAG chemical compounds dataset using **GraphSAGE** with global mean pooling. The notebook includes dataset preparation, model implementation, training, testing, and 3D visualization of graph embeddings via PCA.

The notebooks demonstrate:
- Loading and exploring graph datasets.
- Defining and training GNN models.
- Evaluating performance metrics like accuracy and loss.
- Visualizing graphs and embeddings in 2D/3D for deeper insights into learned representations.

These examples are **fully runnable notebooks**, making it easy to reproduce results and experiment with GNN architectures.
