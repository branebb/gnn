# Graph Neural Networks

<div align="justify">

This repository contains **two example projects demonstrating Graph Neural Networks (GNNs)** using PyTorch Geometric:

1. **GCN on Cora** – A node classification task on the Cora citation network using a **Graph Convolutional Network (GCN)**.  
2. **GraphSAGE on MUTAG** – A graph classification task on the MUTAG dataset using **GraphSAGE** with global mean pooling.  

The notebooks illustrate the **entire workflow** from dataset loading, model definition, training, evaluation, to visualization of embeddings and graph structures. These examples are designed to be **educational** and provide a starting point for experimentation with graph-based deep learning methods.
